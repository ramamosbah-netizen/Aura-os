# AURA OS — Due-Diligence Audit · ADDENDUM (Blueprint conformance · E2E traces · measured depth)

> ⚠️ **PARTIALLY SUPERSEDED (2026-06-30).** §C "chain automation ≈ 20%" is **corrected** — the chain is auto-orchestrated by the event reactor. Tier-1 finance/ERP-correctness backlog (statements, period-close, budgeting, rev-rec, multi-currency, consolidation, approval matrix) is **largely closed**. See **`2026-06-30-depth-analysis-current-state.md`**. Preserved unedited below.

> Companion to `2026-06-29-enterprise-due-diligence-audit.md`. This addendum answers the 10 deeper questions the first pass skipped: **(1) conformance to the Blueprint/Module-Map/Constitution, (2) per-workflow completeness, (3) inter-module chains, (4) end-to-end traces, (5) business-rule side-effects, (6) a real competitor matrix, (7) measured DB depth, (8) measured code quality, (9) performance, (10) deeper frontend** — plus the **per-domain done/missing table** and a **numbered, prioritized backlog**.

## A. BLUEPRINT CONFORMANCE (the biggest miss in pass 1)

Source of intent: `docs/AURA-OS-V2-MODULE-MAP.md` (5-layer model) + `docs/AURA-0.2-MASTER-BLUEPRINT.md` §4 (net-new gaps). Comparison = *intended capability* vs *what exists in code*.

### L1 — Kernel / Platform (Admin Center surface)
| Blueprint capability | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Event Bus / Outbox | ✅ | `core/events` (relay, dead-letter, retry). |
| Tenants / Org / Company / BU | ✅ | `core/tenancy` + `identity/org.service`. |
| AI Providers | ⚠ | `core/ai` provider+embedder, LOCAL fallback. |
| Integrations / API Mgmt | ⚠ | `core/integration` webhooks + SDK-gen; **no API gateway / key mgmt / portal**. |
| Feature Flags / Settings | ⚠ | `feature-flag.service` exists; **no Admin UI**. |
| DMS substrate (storage/versioning/**OCR**/**AI classification**/search) | ⚠ | versioning+search ✅; **OCR ❌, AI classification ❌, object-store ❌**. |
| **Admin Center (UI over all platform svcs)** | ❌ | no admin console. |
| **Security Center** | ❌ | none. |
| **Data Governance** | ❌ | none. |
| **Config Versioning** | ❌ | none. |
| **Backup** | ❌ | none. |
| **Monitoring** | ❌ | none. |
| **Marketplace** | ❌ | none. |
| **L1 conformance** | **~45%** | Eventing/tenancy/integration core present; the *Admin/Platform governance* half is unbuilt. |

### L2 — 16 Business modules
All 16 blueprint contexts exist **+ AMC = 17** (breadth ✅ ~100%). **Depth ⚠ ~55–65%** (see §G per-domain table). Ownership rules from Module-Map §3 (Variations split client→Projects / sub→Subcontracts; Retention cert→Subcontracts, GL→Finance; NCR→Quality) are **correctly honoured** in code.

### L3 — Intelligence
| Capability | Status |
|---|---|
| AI Center / Insights / Briefing | ⚠ (heuristic) |
| Agents | ❌ (no wired agents) |
| Knowledge Graph | ❌ |
| Event Intelligence | ⚠ (process-mining service, not wired to live stream) |
| Forecasting / Anomaly / Risk | ⚠ (stubs) |
| Executive Copilot | ❌ |
| **L3 conformance** | **~35%** |

### L4 — Optimization
| Capability | Status |
|---|---|
| Pricing Intelligence (IEC) | ⚠ `pricing.service` heuristic |
| CBS | ✅ Projects CBS |
| Client Profitability | ❌ |
| Tender Scoring | ❌ |
| Document Intelligence | ❌ |
| **L4 conformance** | **~30%** |

### L5 — Experience
| Capability | Status |
|---|---|
| Modern UI shell | ⚠ functional, no design system |
| BI / Analytics dashboards | ❌ |
| Customer Portal | ❌ |
| Supplier Portal | ❌ (supplier master now exists as its backend) |
| Mobile Workforce / offline | ❌ |
| **L5 conformance** | **~25%** (1 of 4 apps; 0 of 3 portals/mobile) |

### Master §4 greenfield gaps (blueprint's own deferred list) — **all still open**
Document Intelligence/OCR ❌ · pgvector ❌ (JSON-cosine still) · Group consolidation ❌ · Kafka/queue ❌ · Mobile/offline ❌. **Consistent — none delivered yet.**

**Blueprint conformance overall ≈ 48%** (L2 breadth carries it; L1-Admin, L3, L4, L5 drag it down).

---

## B. WORKFLOW COMPLETENESS (does each chain run end-to-end?)

Verified by tracing domain state-machines + service methods + events. ✅ step works · ⚠ partial · ❌ absent.

### Finance — Invoice lifecycle
`Create ✅ → Approve ✅ → Post-to-GL ⚠ (journal auto-posted on payment, not on approval) → Pay ✅ (idempotent) → Reconcile ✅ (bank-rec) → Close-period ❌ → Report ❌ (P&L projection exists; no B/S, no statements UI)`
**Break points:** period-close and financial-statement reporting. **Workflow completeness ≈ 65%** (not the 80% pass-1 implied for the module as a whole).

### Procurement→Pay (P2P)
`PR ✅ → Approve ⚠ (status only, no matrix) → RFQ ✅ → Quote ✅ → Award ✅ → PO ✅ → GRN ✅ → 3-way match ⚠ (client-side compare) → AP Invoice ✅ → Payment ✅ → GL ✅ → Cash-flow ❌ → Reports ❌`
**Break points:** approval matrix, cash-flow, reporting. **≈ 70%.**

### Order-to-Cash (deal chain)
`Lead ✅ → Opportunity ✅ → Quotation ✅ → Tender ✅ → Contract ✅ → Project ✅ → Customer Invoice ✅ → Receipt ✅ → AR Aging ✅ → Revenue recognition ❌`
**Break point:** rev-rec (IFRS-15 / % complete billing link to EVM). **≈ 75%.**

### Service / AMC
`Contract ✅ → PPM schedule ✅ → Generate visit ✅ → Work order ✅ → Ticket/SLA ✅ → Invoice ❌ (AMC not linked to Finance) → Persistence ❌ (in-memory)`
**Break points:** AMC has **no persistence** and **no billing link**. **≈ 45%.**

---

## C. INTER-MODULE CHAIN (measured)

**Finding (measured):** direct cross-module service imports are almost zero — only **Finance imports Procurement + Inventory** (1 each). The deal-chain is wired by **reference-ID + snapshot copying**, not orchestrated calls:
- Parent-reference fields counted in domain types: `projectId ×75`, `accountId ×29`, `contractId ×19`, `poId ×19`, `tenderId ×7`, `prId ×4`.
- A **saga orchestrator** exists (`core/workflow/saga-orchestrator.service.ts` + migration `0043` + stores) but is **not wired** to auto-propagate the deal chain.

**Implication:** the chain is *navigable* (you can trace a project back to its contract→tender→account by id) but **not automated** — creating a Contract from a won Tender, or a Project from a Contract, is a manual re-entry with a copied reference, not a one-click conversion. **This is the single biggest functional-ERP gap** and is invisible in a file-by-file audit. **Chain automation ≈ 20%.**

---

## D. BUSINESS-RULE SIDE-EFFECTS (when X is approved, what fires?)

| Side-effect on a state change | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Domain event emitted | ✅ | 196 distinct event types; appended in the same tx as the write. |
| Audit trail updated | ✅ | `core/audit` + audit migration. |
| Read-model/projection updated | ⚠ | `ProjectionEngine` + P&L projection exist; most reads still hit transactional tables. |
| Dashboard updated | ❌ | no module dashboards to update. |
| Budget impacted | ❌ | no budgeting module. |
| Forecast impacted | ⚠ | intelligence forecasting is heuristic and **not subscribed to live events**. |
| AI notified / proposes | ⚠ | guardrails/autonomy exist; **not wired to the live event stream or a real model**. |
| Notification sent | ❌ | notifications service unwired (no email/SMS/push). |
**Side-effect propagation ≈ 40%** — events+audit are solid; budget/forecast/AI/dashboards/notifications do **not** react.

---

## E. COMPETITOR FEATURE MATRIX (the table pass 1 lacked)

✅ strong · ◐ partial · ✗ absent.

| Capability | SAP S/4 | Oracle | Dynamics 365 | Odoo | **AURA** |
|---|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| Multi-company / tenant | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ◐ (app-level) |
| Multi-currency + FX reval | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✗ |
| Financial statements (B/S,P&L,CF) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✗ |
| Double-entry GL | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Budgeting / forecasting | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ◐ | ✗ |
| P2P (PR→PO→GRN→Invoice) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Inventory valuation (FIFO/WAC) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✗ |
| Project costing / EVM | ✅ | ✅ | ◐ | ◐ | ✅ |
| Construction (IPC/subcontract/ITP) | ◐ | ◐ | ✗ | ✗ | ✅ **(vertical edge)** |
| Payroll (WPS/UAE) | ◐ | ◐ | ◐ | ◐ | ◐ (no WPS file) |
| Workflow designer (no-code) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✗ |
| BI / dashboards | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ◐ | ✗ |
| Mobile app | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✗ |
| RBAC admin UI | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✗ |
| Localization / i18n | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✗ |
| Audit trail | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Extensibility / marketplace | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✗ |
| Observability / SLA | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ◐ | ✗ |
| Modern event-sourced core | ◐ | ◐ | ◐ | ✗ | ✅ |

**Read:** AURA wins on **modern architecture** and **UAE-construction vertical depth**; loses on **every horizontal-ERP table-stakes capability** (multi-currency, statements, budgeting, BI, workflow designer, mobile, admin UIs, i18n, observability). Competes as a **vertical niche product**, not a horizontal ERP.

---

## F. MEASURED DEPTH (counts, not adjectives)

### Database (across 71 migrations)
| Object | Count | Note |
|---|--:|---|
| Tables (`aura_*`, distinct) | **110** | |
| Indexes | **146** | ~1.3/table — adequate, no composite/partial tuning evident |
| Foreign keys | **42** | **LOW vs 110 tables** — confirms snapshot-not-FK design; cross-tenant integrity rests on app code |
| CHECK constraints | **38** | enum/amount guards |
| Triggers | **1** | double-entry balance enforcement (`0050`) |
| Functions | **5** | |
| **Views** | **0** | ❌ no reporting views |
| jsonb columns | **38** | line-items/points/policies |
| RLS-enabled | **99** | |
| Policies (explicit + dynamic) | **48 + 7** | |
| **Down-migrations** | **0** | ❌ no rollback path |
| Duplicate index | **0059 ×2** | projects-variations vs petty-cash |

### Code quality (src `.ts`, excl node_modules/dist)
| Metric | Count | Verdict |
|---|--:|---|
| TODO | **0** | ✅ clean |
| FIXME | **0** | ✅ |
| `console.log` | **1** | ✅ negligible |
| `@ts-ignore`/`@ts-expect-error` | **0** | ✅ |
| `any` (`: any`/`as any`/`<any>`) | **124** | ⚠ mostly pg-row mappers (`row: any`) — type the rows |
| `eslint-disable` | **0** | ✅ |
| Root ESLint config | **absent** | ⚠ `lint` is a turbo task but no enforced root config found |
| Event taxonomy (distinct types) | **196** | ✅ rich, consistent `domain.aggregate.action` |

**Code quality is genuinely clean** — no TODO/FIXME debt, no suppressions, no logging litter. The real debt is **missing tests/ops**, not messy code. Main smells: 124 `any` in mappers; duplicate `0059`; the stale-`dist/` workspace-rebuild trap hit repeatedly this session.

---

## G. PER-DOMAIN: DONE vs MISSING (the table requested)

| Domain | Done % | What's complete | Top missing |
|---|--:|---|---|
| Kernel/eventing | 85% | outbox, audit, tenancy, workflow, numbering, saga store | event-replay, admin UI |
| Kernel/platform-gov | 30% | feature-flags svc | Admin Center, Security Center, config-versioning, backup, monitoring |
| Security | 40% | RBAC/ABAC engine, audit | DB-enforced RLS, real auth, secrets/KMS |
| CRM | 70% | accounts, leads, opps, quotations | contacts, activities, email |
| Tendering | 65% | tenders, BOQ | bid scoring, estimate engine |
| Contracts | 68% | contracts, IPC certs | clause library, obligations, auto-from-tender |
| Projects | 72% | WBS, CBS, EVM, delay/EOT, variations | Gantt, resource levelling, rev-rec |
| Procurement | 78% | PR/RFQ/PO, supplier master | approval matrix, PO↔supplier FK, framework agreements |
| Inventory | 75% | GRN, stock, transfers | valuation, reorder, barcode |
| Finance | 72%* | AP+AR, payments, GL, VAT, petty cash, BG, aging, bank-rec | statements, budgeting, period-close, multi-currency (*workflow 65%) |
| HR | 72% | employees, leave, payroll, EOSB, timesheets, claims, advances, doc-expiry | attendance, WPS file, appraisal, org chart |
| HSE | 60% | incidents, PTW, CAPA, toolbox | risk assessment, audits, training matrix |
| Quality | 60% | NCR, IR, snags, ITP | calibration, audit schedule |
| Site | 60% | diaries, delays, materials, instructions | labour-by-trade, progress % |
| Subcontracts | 65% | subcontracts, claims, variations | back-charges, retention-release UI |
| Doc-Control | 58% | transmittals, correspondence, submittals | drawing register, distribution matrix |
| Engineering | 55% | drawings, RFIs, submittals | MAR/TQ, model viewer |
| Fleet | 60% | vehicles, fuel, maintenance, fines | Salik/tolls, telematics |
| Assets | 60% | register, maintenance, inspections, depreciation | disposal/GL, QR |
| AMC | 45% | contracts, tickets, WOs, dispatch, PPM | **persistence**, Finance billing link |
| Intelligence (L3) | 35% | insight/briefing/guardrails scaffolds | agents, KG, live model, event-subscribe |
| Optimization (L4) | 30% | CBS, pricing heuristic | profitability, tender scoring, doc-intel |
| Experience (L5) | 25% | web shell, ⌘K, theme | BI, dashboards, portals×2, mobile |
| Infra/DevOps | 15% | migrations runner | CI/CD, Docker, observability, backup |
| Testing | 45% | 90 unit files, 1 tenant guard | e2e, coverage gate, perf, security |

---

## H. PERFORMANCE (assessed)
- **N+1 risk:** ⚠ aggregation endpoints (AR/AP aging, EVM rollup) `list()` then compute in-app — fine at SME scale, will need projections at volume.
- **Pagination:** ❌ `limit`-only, no cursor/total — large tenants will hit unbounded scans.
- **Connection pool / batching / streaming:** ⚠ single `pg` pool, no statement batching, no streaming exports.
- **Caching:** ❌ none.
- **Indexes:** ✅ tenant/status/FK covered; ❌ no composite/partial tuning for hot queries.
- **Perf overall ≈ 45%** — no load testing performed or possible without a deploy.

---

## I. FRONTEND DEPTH (57 pages / 162 BFF routes)
| Aspect | Verdict |
|---|---|
| Design system / tokens | ❌ inline-style objects per component; no Tailwind/shadcn/MUI |
| Component reuse | ⚠ copy-paste table/form/card pattern across ~22 new pages |
| Form validation UX | ❌ server-side only; no inline/field-level |
| Charts / data-viz | ❌ none |
| Dashboards | ❌ no module/exec dashboards |
| Accessibility | ❌ no ARIA/keyboard/contrast audit |
| Responsive / mobile | ⚠ fixed max-widths, unverified |
| Loading / skeleton / toast | ❌ minimal ("API offline"/empty only) |
| Animations / transitions | ❌ |
| Dark mode | ✅ |
| Command palette / search | ✅ |
**Frontend depth ≈ 50%** — consistent and fast to extend, but utilitarian; not a commercial design system.

---

## J. "IS IT DONE?" — the answer, quantified
**No.** It is **~62% engineering / ~48% blueprint / ~35% production / ~30% commercial.** What makes it 62% (not 90%): the **automation/orchestration of the chains, the platform/admin layer, observability/DevOps, security-enforcement, BI/dashboards, and the L3/L4/L5 layers** are largely unbuilt — even though the L2 module *breadth* is near-complete.

---

## L. CORRECTIONS TO PASS-1
- Finance: module breadth ~80% but **workflow completeness ~65%** (period-close & statements absent) — pass-1 over-stated it.
- Triggers: pass-1 implied few; **measured = exactly 1** (double-entry).
- Deal-chain: pass-1 said "no cycles, inward deps" (true) but **missed that the chain is not orchestrated** — the most important functional gap (§C).
- Code quality: now **measured clean** (0 TODO/FIXME, 1 console.log) — better than a generic "25% debt" implied; debt is in *tests/ops*, not code.

*End of addendum. Measured, source-verified, no files modified.*
